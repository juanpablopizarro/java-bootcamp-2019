# Welcome to Java Bootcamp 2019!

## Introduction
Hi! get ready to jump from Java Core to **REST and backend things**. This bootcamp will give you some important concepts and tools in order to get ready for a job, the only precondition is that you will need some git and java core knowledge.

But what exactly I need to complete this without blow my mind?. The response is: to know how to write java classes, the common things (loops, collections, blah) and how to use git as beginner level, it means fork, branching, push, pull request and the most important thing.. want to be a backend developer!

If you don't have the pre requisites you always can ramp it up quickly using:

Java Standard Edition:
- [Getting Started](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html)
- [Java Language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)
- [Essential Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/index.html)
- [Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html)
- [Github Essentials](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

In order to be in touch we will use a slack channel. **THIS IS NOT A TALENT CONTEST IS A COLLABORATIVE SPACE** please use the communication channels to keep in touch, show progress, responds to others, make jokes and share cool memes!. We'll provide a slack channel we the bootcamp starts.

If you are not familiar with slack you can install and learn about it very quickly with this [link](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members).

So.. are you ready for a very focused and quick learning???

## Bootcamp Objective & Organization
The main objective of this bootcamp is bring people from java and programming basis knowledge to backend development. To be a backend developer implies a lot of things a maybe years of expertise to reach a senior level but do not panic, we will just give you a quick and focused knowledge in order to write a REST API that expose a set of features to the world. This API will persists data in a database using an ORM and will expose API specs using a API documentation framework.

But.. what a **** is an API?, don't worry, we will cover a lot of things in the middle.

In order to have a sort of guide we will divide the bootcamp in 3 weeks and each one could have 1 or more topics. Our expectations is that you may spend up to 4 hours a day depends on your previous knowledge and your slack participation.

We will provide you some tutors in order to guide you and respond specific questions, but remember **this is a self training and your effort and communication really matters**. We will be here to answer questions and give you tips.

Our recommendations to be successful on this bootcamp are:

>- Make a routine, that will help you to finish the bootcamp
>- Participate on the slack channels
>- Don't be afraid to ask or more important.. to answer others
>- Test and tray all.. just reading is not enough
>- Keep positive and do your best.. remember is just 3 weeks
>- If tutors give you the chance to assist to a Q&A session, assist even you have nothing pending!!!
